# jquery-multiple-dragdrop
Uses JQuery to allow drag-drop from 3 source boxes into fourth destination box.

I created this page about 5 years ago for a client that wanted a sample page that
allows someone to create a meal by dragging items from 3 source boxes into a fourth
Meal box. At least one item from each of the source boxes must be selected.

For this demo, I used JQuery (I've included a more recent version in this repository).

When you click Submit, it will let you know how many items you've placed in the Meal box,
and warn you if you haven't selected at least one item from each source box.
